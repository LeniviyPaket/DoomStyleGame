# My Doom-like game

This project was inspired by my dream of finally creating a 3D in python

Based on the project from [this tutorial](https://youtu.be/ECqUrT7IdqQ)

## Any changes?
Actually, there were some changes to the project mentioned before.
Changes:
+ Added TBOI-like floor system (rn there is only one floor without any great variety in rooms)
+ Added floor randomization
+ Added minimap for easier navigation
+ Added controls pop-up

What was taken from the source project?
+ Core files & architecture
+ Raycasting and wall renderer
+ Sprites (cuz it was hard to find fine looking ones with needed resolution)

## Plans & known issues
Issues:
+ Occasional out-of-bounds and game crashes on door interaction
+ Low performance on non-gaming machines (tested on laptop & PC)
Plans:
+ Addition of weapons & enemies to shoot
+ Addition of more room presets
+ Making the game more rogue-like (in terms of progression between locations)

### Alert
To use this properly it's recommended to remove "DoomStyleGame" from paths to files in [object_renderer.py](object_renderer.py) unless you want to open this project as as subfolder in VSCode workspace
